# MitaBot


Hi, I'm Mita! A new integration bot using neural network and AI tools. You won't be bored with me.


🤖 About Mita
Mita is an intelligent Discord bot that leverages Google Gemini's AI to provide helpful, conversational responses. Designed with a friendly and professional tone, Mita can assist with answering questions, brainstorming ideas, and more—all within your Discord server.

🔧 Key Features
✅ AI-Powered Responses – Uses Google Gemini for accurate, natural answers
✅ Privacy-Focused – Doesn’t store your messages long-term
✅ Easy Setup – Simple configuration with slash commands
✅ Customizable – Adjustable settings for moderation and behavior

🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ User Interaction
Users invoke Mita with the /ask command followed by their question.

/ask What’s the best way to learn Python?  
2️⃣ Request Handling
The bot sends the query to Google Gemini’s API (specifically the gemini-2.0-flash model).

Gemini processes the input and generates a response.

3️⃣ Response Delivery
Mita formats the answer into an embed (with colors, thumbnails, and user attribution).

Replies are trimmed to Discord’s 2000-character limit for compatibility.

4️⃣ Privacy & Data Flow
No message logging – Queries are transient (Google Gemini may retain data per their policy).

No training on user data – Mita doesn’t improve its model from your inputs.
